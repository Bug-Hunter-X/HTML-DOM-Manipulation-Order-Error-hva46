This repository demonstrates a subtle but problematic error in HTML: executing JavaScript code to manipulate DOM elements before they've been parsed and rendered.  The bug is caused by incorrect script placement within the HTML file.  The solution shows the correct placement to avoid the error.  This is important because such order-related errors can lead to unexpected behavior or application crashes.
